# tumor-detection-project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to accurately detect whether a tumor is **benign (B)** or **malignant (M)** using real-world medical data. The dataset contains various features that describe tumor characteristics like mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, and more. I began by cleaning the datasetâ€”removing unnecessary columns like `id` and unnamed fields, and checking for any missing values. I then conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize the distribution of diagnosis labels and understand feature correlations using heatmaps. After preprocessing and scaling the data, I split it into training and testing sets. I used a **Random Forest Classifier** to train the model and achieved strong accuracy in classifying tumors. Visual tools such as count plots and correlation maps were included to provide deeper insight into the dataset. This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in making faster and more reliable diagnostic decisions in healthcare.
